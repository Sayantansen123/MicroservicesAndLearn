Symmetric encryption, also known as "secret key" or "private key" encryption, is a cryptography technique that uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data:

How it works -->

    Uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt data

Strengths -->

    Fast, strong cryptographic strength per bit of key

Weaknesses -->

    Key must be securely shared before communication

Uses -->

    Data security, secure communication, web browsing, cloud security, database encryption, and more

Asymmetric encryption, also known as public key encryption, is a method of encrypting and decrypting data using a public/private key pair:

Encryption: The public key in the pair is used to encrypt plaintext.

Decryption: The corresponding private key in the pair is used to decrypt the ciphertext.
