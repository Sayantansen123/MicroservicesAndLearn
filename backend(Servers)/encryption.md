How it works -->

    Uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt data

Strengths -->

    Fast, strong cryptographic strength per bit of key

Weaknesses -->

    Key must be securely shared before communication

Uses -->

    Data security, secure communication, web browsing, cloud security, database encryption, and more
