Symmetric encryption, also known as "secret key" or "private key" encryption, is a cryptography technique that uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data: 
 

How it works ==>

Uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt data

Strengths ==>

Fast, strong cryptographic strength per bit of key

Weaknesses ==>

Key must be securely shared before communication

Uses ==>

Data security, secure communication, web browsing, cloud security, database encryption, and more
